    <center><p >A home page is the primary web page that a visitor will view when they navigate to a website via a search engine, and it may also function as a landing page to attract visitors.[3] In some cases, the home page is a site directory, particularly when a website has multiple home pages.

        Good home page design is usually a high priority for a website; for example, 
        a news website may curate headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links to 
        full articles. According to Homepage Usability, the homepage is the "most important
         page on any website" and receives the most views of any page. A poorly designed home page
          can overwhelm and deter visitors from the site. One important use of home pages is communicating 
          the identity and value of a company.
          One of the commonly found aspects of a homepage is a hero image, a large eye-catching banner 
          image often containing a photograph or drawing depicting the webpage owner's values, services, etc. <br>
          as a message.[11][12] Hero images are immediately visible above the fold, without scrolling the page down.
          [13] A hero image may have several complementary elements as an overlay
          , such as the website's logo, a call to action, and a brief description.</p></center>
